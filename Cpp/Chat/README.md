# Chat
A command line chat application experiment.

- author: andreasl

Either this or the chat application in `Chat3` worked, or possibly both.
I also created a project called `Chat2` which however only contained sources I found on the net,
nothing I have written myself. Consequently, I deleted `Chat2`.

**The project is not maintained anymore.**
