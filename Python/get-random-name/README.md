# Get a random name
Get a random name via behindthename.com/random.

## Setup
Set up a Python virtual environment and install the requirements, e.g. via `setup.sh`:
E.g., run:
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

## Run
Prior to running the script, review the code. Inspect and modify the search queries to your needs.

Run the script in the virtual environment you created when you set the project up.
E.g., run:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python get-name.py
```

You may want to run it via `nohup` and detach it from the shell. E.g. run:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
nohup python get-name.py &
```
