"""Showcase the use of the 3rd party TTS library `chatterbox`.

It's really viable for easy voice synthetization and voice cloning.

For my CPU-only laptop, I had to hack
`.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/chatterbox/tts.py` with most calls to
`torch.load()` with an extra argument `map_location=torch.device('cpu')`.
