# CFFI Hello
Showcase the usage of the 3rd party library CFFI.

See https://cffi.readthedocs.io

CFFI can call native library functions that lie in `.dll` or `.so` files via Python.

There is also standard-library alternative, `ctypes`, but `ctypes` is allegedly harder to write and
executes slower.


Run:
```bash
pip install .
```

Then, you can run `main.py`.
