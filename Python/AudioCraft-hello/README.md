# AudioCraft Hello
Showcase AudioCraft, a text to audio generation library.

Tested it on a PC rig with a 2080 TI. However, used the CPUs and not the GPUs.

Seems to require lotsof VRAM (allegedly 16GB for the medium model).  
Seems to run on the CPU on the testing machine with a 2080 TI, thus not so fast.
However, this allows to use the GPU for other tasks.
