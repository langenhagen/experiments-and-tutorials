# Experiments and Tutorials
Files and projects related to learning programming concepts, languages, their libraries as well as
prototypes.

Find prototypes and small proofs of concepts to a set of programming languages and their libraries
here.

Some of the stuff in here dates back until around the year 2000. Most of the programming languages
and environments changed since. Given today's environments and technologies, I assume that one may
have a hard time compiling or running the code in here. I suspect it may be infeasible to build the
artifacts anew. Thus, I keep still existing original build artifacts and project files in the
repository in order to allow future examination.
